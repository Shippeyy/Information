## AirQualityBot
[AirQualityBot Repository](https://github.com/WoN-Hackathon-2019/won-airqualitybot)

A [WebOfNeeds](https://github.com/researchstudio-sat/webofneeds)-Bot to regularly fetch air quality data from https://docs.openaq.org/ and publish them as WoN-atoms to a WoN-node.


# Cooperations
The provided atoms are then used by the [PollutionWarningBot](https://github.com/WoN-Hackathon-2019/won-pollutionwarningbot) to warn subscribers whenever newly available data exceeds some limits.
