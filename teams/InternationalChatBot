# Projects
## Example Project
[This bot](https://github.com/WoN-Hackathon-2019/InternationalChatBot) allows you to connect to a chat partner anywhere in the world (or in a specific country if desired). It breaks the language barrier by translating every message to the corresponding language of the receiver. This is done by using the WoN TranslateBot.

# Cooperations
We are using the services of the [TranslateBot](https://github.com/WoN-Hackathon-2019/translatebot) for Handling the Translation of messages.
